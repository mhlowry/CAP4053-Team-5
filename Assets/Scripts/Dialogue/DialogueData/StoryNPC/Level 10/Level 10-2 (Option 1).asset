  - Your gratitude is appreciated, Swordie! With the Mymders gone, things should
    ease up.
  - And speaking of easing up, getting Ic back in action would greatly relieve Berque's
    burden. Fingers crossed!
  - "Not to mention, I might get to see my good pal Dokai again\u2026"
  - "Ah, erm, anyways, thank you for all your services\u2014 my friend, it\u2019s
    been a great pleasure working with you.\r\n"
  - "I don\u2019t have any contracts left at the moment.  But please, feel free to
    revisit any other contract you\u2019ve completed.  I won\u2019t take any of the
    gates down yet.\r"
  - "You\u2019ve definitely made a name for yourself\u2014 I feel like I can\u2019t
    go two islands out without hearing about your deeds nowadays."
  - "I\u2019m always here to chat if you\u2019re willing to listen."
