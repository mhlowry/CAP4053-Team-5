  - Start believing!  Listen, your next mission involves protecting a very valuable
    piece of equipment of theirs...
  - '"The Stralina Traveling Eco Research Assistant."  Otherwise known as STERA.'
  - "These clients are trying to learn more about the nature of Stralina\u2019s biolife
    through this little machine."
  - "They\u2019ve been very helpful in Great Tear reconstruction efforts over the
    past few centuries.\r\n\r"
  - 'Who knows?  If we work with these outsiders, we might see a whole Stralina again. '
  - "Though, we\u2019d also have to find the body of Ic, the land god, in order to
    do that.\r\n\r"
  - "Anyways, go on!  May Berque bless you.\r"
