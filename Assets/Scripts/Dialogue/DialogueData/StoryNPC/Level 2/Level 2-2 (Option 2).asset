  - The Great Tear! Some Millennium ago, in the age of Four Guardians...
  - 'Stralina was actually a whole, complete world under the rule of one, powerful
    guardian: King Cyren MacRutonk.'
  - "He and the other three guardians were very efficient at keeping peace throughout
    the world- until the death of Cyren\u2019s wife drove him mad.\r\n"
  - 'To take revenge on the world that took her from him, he tore Stralina apart,
    bit by bit- leaving us with the floating islands we know today.

'
  - "The other three guardians tried to stop him and keep the world together, but
    in the end, it wasn\u2019t meant to be."
  - 'Two guardians went into hiding, and Stralina lost the other two- one to death,
    and the other to insanity.

'
  - "I think that\u2019s enough history lesson for now, why don\u2019t you take care
    of our latest contract?  May Berque bless you.\r"
