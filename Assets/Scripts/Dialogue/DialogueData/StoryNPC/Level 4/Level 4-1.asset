  dialogue:
  - "Good afternoon, adventurer.  I sent STERA back to the otherworld, thank you
    for your contributions, as always.\r"
  - "I saw that you encountered some Mymders in the STERA data!  They\u2026 freak
    me out, a little.\r"
  - "When the Great Tear happened, a lot of organizations cropped up to try and seize
    power.\r\n\r"
  - "One of these organizations was known as \u201CThe Eight Legs,\u201D who tried
    to take up the mantle of the Four Guardians in a sick, twisted sort of way.\r\n"
  - "Some followers of Berque, the Church of Heaven\u2019s Embrace, ended up driving
    the Eight Legs out of Stralina."
  - Unfortunately, not before the first Mymders was created...
  - 'A soulless creature designed to manufacture counterfeits.  All in the name of
    profit, power, and control.

'
  - "It\u2019s unnatural, and their presence is only growing\u2026"
  - "Hah! Maybe one day I\u2019ll contract you to exterminate them!  Wouldn\u2019t
    that be something?\r\n"
