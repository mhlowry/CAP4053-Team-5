  - 'Ah, you''re intrigued! Here''s the deal: I''ve found the original Mymders.'
  - Taking on this contract could drastically boost your standing in Stralina, transforming
    you from a 'reliable swordsman' to a celebrated hero with a distinguished title!
  - "Something like, ah, the Calamity Slayer!  Or the Mymders Hater!  Or\u2026 something
    along those lines.\r\n"
  - "But above all that, you\u2019ll be doing myself, and Stralina, a favor."
  - Your last STERA expedition brought some interesting results from otherworld,
    and it has to do with the god, Ic.
  - Ic is known to have a connection with the souls of our world, and the artificial
    souls manufactured by Mymders are something of a cancer for them.
  - 'By attacking the disease at its core, it might make it easier for Ic to recover
    from the Great Tear.

  - "I\u2019ve opened a gate that will take you to the safest period of time I could
    find to eliminate the threat.\r\n"
  - "May the gods protect you, my friend!  I\u2019ll see you soon.\r\n"
