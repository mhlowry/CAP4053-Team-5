  - Yes, time travel! It's a curious concept, isn't it?
  - Now, about the Great Tear, many wonder why time travel isn't used to prevent
    it. The truth is, time is a delicate fabric, not to be tampered with lightly.
  - "Well, I\u2019m sure the Guardians certainly tried.  But frankly, if they weren\u2019t
    strong enough to defeat Cyren before, I doubt they\u2019re strong enough now.\r"
  - "For instance, Cyren\u2019s right hand man, the guardian Rylo Mawcei, was arguably
    stronger than the king himself.\r"
  - "Unfortunately, it\u2019s much easier to break an egg than keep it together. 
    Rylo himself was torn apart in a desperate attempt to keep Stralina whole.\r"
  - "There was no convincing him to let go\u2026"
  - "Point being,I don\u2019t think that it would help much at all to dwell on events
    that happened thousands of years ago.\r\n"
  - "We grow and adapt as time moves on, and I think the people of Stralina have
    done a good job making omelets.\r"
  - "Anyways, you know the drill. May Berque keep you safe!\r"
