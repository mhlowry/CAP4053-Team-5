  dialogue:
  - 'Your efforts are evident, Journeyman! '
  - Speaking of legends, did you know about the two gods of Stralina? I realized
    I haven't shared much about them yet.
  - Berque, god of the sky, is a righteous being that- frankly, is the reason Stralina
    is still here after the Great Tear.
  - "It\u2019s through their will that these bits and pieces we call home don\u2019t
    just go flying off into space.\r\n"
  - "Ic, god of the land, was, for obvious reasons, deeply wounded by King Cyren\u2019s
    rampage.  No one is even sure they\u2019re still alive.\r\n"
  - "But, you know, I\u2019ve always suspected one of the Guardians to go into hiding-
    Dokai Orochimiftu- did so in order to nurse Ic back to health.\r\n"
  - "That\u2019s just speculation though.  Say, you wouldn\u2019t be interested in
    joining the Church of Heaven\u2019s Embrace, would you?\r\n"
  responses:
  - responseText: Maybe.
