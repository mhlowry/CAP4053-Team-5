  - I see, it's somewhat in your memory.
  - 'Anyway, this might intrigue you: recent otherworld research indicates there''s
    technically only one Mymder. It''s quite a revelation, isn''t it?'
  - "They operate in a hive mind, and there\u2019s a source to their consciousness,
    down in another realm somewhere."
  - "I suspect that it\u2019s the original Mymders, grown in power from each soul
    it\u2019s copied and drained.\r"
  - "I\u2019m going to work to find a point in time where you would be able to eliminate
    it!  I never actually expected to contract you for this..."
  - But I see a real opportunity here. For now, I need you to take STERA out on another
    research mission.
  - 'I know, I know, we had a contract from otherworld not too long ago.

'
  - However, I think we could benefit very strongly from more information surrounding
    Mymders.
  - "If we\u2019re going to pursue an undertaking as intense as eliminating a species,
    we should be prepared.\r\n"
  - "I will find that point in time while you\u2019re out and about.  May Berque
    protect you.\r\n"
